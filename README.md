# Sauce Orchestrate YAML Config Generator

"That's SO YAML" is a YAML generator for use with the implementation of Sauce Orchestrate. Instead of assembling a YAML file themselves, clients may use the configurator to quickly generate one. Takes strong inspiration from Sauce Labs' Platform Configurator.
